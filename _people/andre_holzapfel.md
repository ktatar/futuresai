## Bio

Andre Holzapfel is Associate Professor of Media Technology with specialization in Sound and Music Computing at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. He holds one PhD degree in Computer Science, and a second PhD degree in Ethnomusicology. This multidisciplinary background helps him to investigate the potential of combining quantitative, computational methods with qualitative, ethnographic methods in music research, an investigation that he likes to refer to as Computational Ethnomusicology. In the recent years, he has extended his research to the analysis of human movement using motion capture analysis, and the investigation of ethical, legal, and sustainability implications of artificial intelligence in creative contexts. Despite having a degree in Computer Science he does not like coding. He is a passionate player of the Cretan lute, and used to perform Greek Rembetiko music.
