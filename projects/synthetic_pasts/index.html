The project scrutinises how generative AI models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion inherit, transform, and reframe historical data, raising questions about the cultural and epistemological implications of machine-generated historiography. By situating contemporary AI within media history and media theory, the project develops critical perspectives on the intersections of historical representation, synthetic content, and human creativity.</p> <p><strong>Project Page</strong> <a href="https://maw.wallenberg.org/en/project/study-historical-material-generative-artificial-intelligence" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://maw.wallenberg.org/en/project/study-historical-material-generative-artificial-intelligence</a></p> </body></html>
