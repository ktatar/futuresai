# Description

This project addresses the conceptual and practical interface between artificial intelligence and core archival imperatives. The project encompasses collaboration with the Swedish National Archives (Riksarkivet) and the Swedish National Heritage Board (Riksantikvarie√§mbetet); the project develops AI-based approaches that respect and operationalise fundamental archival principles, such as diplomatics, classification, and authenticity. Through exploring issues of authenticity, heritage futures, and the fight against misinformation, this work contributes both to the archival profession and to public debates on trust in digital memory.
