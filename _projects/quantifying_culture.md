# Description

Quantifying Culture investigates the potential of AI to enrich the management and interpretation of cultural heritage collections across Sweden. The project examines current GLAM digitalisation practices and develops methodologies for AI/ML-enhanced metadata generation, with a focus on ethics, diversity, and compliance with FAIR and international data standards. The research bridges the gap between computational methods and humanistic inquiry, aiming to demonstrate how AI can foster more inclusive, transparent, and engaging models of heritage curation.
