# A Shift in Artistic Practice through Artificial Intelligence

## Abstract

The explosion of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) models has
initiated a cultural shift in arts, music, and media, whereby roles are changing,
values are shifting, and conventions are challenged. The vast, readily available
dataset of the Internet has created an environment for AI models to be trained on
any content on the Web. With AI models shared openly and used by many globally,
how does this new paradigm shift challenge the status quo in artistic practices?
What kind of changes will AI technology bring to music, arts, and new media?
