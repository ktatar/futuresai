Synthetic Pasts examines the roles that history and historicity play in AI-generated text and image production. The project scrutinises how generative AI models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion inherit, transform, and reframe historical data, raising questions about the cultural and epistemological implications of machine-generated historiography. By situating contemporary AI within media history and media theory, the project develops critical perspectives on the intersections of historical representation, synthetic content, and human creativity.
