These metadata standards have evolved over time to accommodate changing needs, growing and diversifying collections, and emerging digital affordances. Yet, for numerous reasons, subject metadata are neither fully nor rigorously implemented in many of today’s catalogues – whether in the backend indices or the front-end end-user interfaces – to the detriment of users. Online public library catalogues, discovery services, journal article databases, university repositories and museum catalogues all demonstrate shortcomings in how subject metadata are integrated, consolidated and leveraged (Golub 2016; Golub 2018; Golub et al. 2020; Golub, Ziolkowski and Zlodi 2022). Properly incorporated, subject metadata could greatly improve the discovery of objects within collections and (because collections are increasingly connected online) the reconciliation of descriptive information across different collections for better cross-database searching. On the other hand, digital technologies could make standardised subject access finally realise the potential always envisioned for it. To make this argument, we explore subject access and associated metadata standards in library and museum cataloguing.  </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Golub1930852" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Representation of Swedish LGBTQ+ Fiction in Commercial Information Services</div> <div class="author"> Koraljka Golub , and Daniel Ihrmark </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Documentation</em>, Jun 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p> PurposeMany end users turn to Google Books and social tagging services to identify books of interest. How successful they are will depend on subject indexing applied in these services (among other factors). The study aimed to determine: (1) to what degree are Queerlit books identified as LGBTQ+ books in widely used information services, in particular Google Books, LibraryThing and Goodreads; and, (2) whether metadata in these information services could be considered of value for the Queerlit database and complement its highly extensive and highly specific indexing. Design/methodology/approachThe study compared keywords (subject index terms, tags) assigned to works of Swedish LGBTQ+ fiction across three commercial services: Google Books, Goodreads and LibraryThing, against the curated database, Queerlit. FindingsOf the 1320 LGBTQ+ works in Queerlit, only a small portion was found in the three web services: 8.26% on Google Books (n = 109), 13.26% on Goodreads (n = 175), while about half on LibraryThing (55.3%, n = 730). This underrepresentation of Swedish LGBTQ+ works in the three international commercial information services makes them hardly of value to the readers. This is exacerbated by the fact that only a minority of Queerlit books found in the three services are categorised as LGBTQ+. The Queerlit database might benefit from consulting social tagging services when indexing both LGBTQ+ specific and general themes. Originality/valueNo earlier study compared in a systematic manner four different information retrieval systems and identified challenges as well as potential benefits in relation to finding LGBTQ+ fiction. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Golub1977760" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">LGBTQ+ Fiction Indexing : Comparing the Value of Professional Index Terms, Social Tags and Automatically Assigned Terms for Information Retrieval</div> <div class="author"> Koraljka Golub </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Exploring Contemporary Classification Practices : Organizing Information, Technological Change and Ideological Contestation</em> , Jun 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="cotton_sounding_2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Sounding out extra-normal AI voice: Non-normative musical engagements with normative AI voice and speech technologies</div> <div class="author"> Kelsey Cotton , and Kıvanç Tatar </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In AIMC 2024</em> , Aug 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a class="bibtex btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Bib</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>How do we challenge the norms of AI voice technologies?

Exploratory Research-through-Design guided an engagement with pre-trained speech synthesis models to reveal their musical affordances in an experimental vocal practice. We recorded this engagement with voice and speech Deep Learning technologies using auto-ethnography, a novel and recent methodology in Human-Computer Interaction. Our position in this paper actively subverts the normative function of these models, provoking nonsensical AI-mediation of human vocality. Emerging from a sense-making process of poetic AI nonsense, we uncover the generative potential of non-normative usage of normative speech recognition and synthesis models. We contribute with insights about the affordances of Research-through-Design to inform artistic working processes with AI models; how AI-mediations reform understandings of human vocality; and artistic perspectives and practice as knowledge-creation mechanisms for working with technology.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">cotton_sounding_2024</span><span class="p">,</span>

It also aimed to contribute to the body of research on aboutness and related challenges in automated subject indexing and evaluation.Design/methodology/approachOn a sample of over 230,000 records with close to 12,000 distinct DDC classes, an open source tool Annif, developed by the National Library of Finland, was applied in the following implementations: lexical algorithm, support vector classifier, fastText, Omikuji Bonsai and an ensemble approach combing the former four. A qualitative study involving two senior catalogue librarians and three students of library and information studies was also conducted to investigate the value and inter-rater agreement of automatically assigned classes, on a sample of 60 records.FindingsThe best results were achieved using the ensemble approach that achieved 66.82% accuracy on the three-digit DDC classification task. The qualitative study confirmed earlier studies reporting low inter-rater agreement but also pointed to the potential value of automatically assigned classes as additional access points in information retrieval.Originality/valueThe paper presents an extensive study of automated classification in an operative library catalogue, accompanied by a qualitative study of automated classes.

It highlights the International Society for Knowl­edge Organization’s initiative to develop metadata guidelines for library catalog procurement, focusing on maximizing the value of subject metadata from classification systems and controlled vocabularies. The paper discusses the rationale for quality subject access, proposes desirable search functionalities based on research, explores implementation challenges, and outlines future developments. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of providing quality subject access in digital services and calls for further research on interface design, guideline adoption, KOS evolution, and the impact of language models on subject metadata use. The work underscores the need for applying controlled vocabularies in search interfaces across libraries, archives, and museums while acknowledging the complementary role of alternative approaches like social tagging and automatic indexing. Extensive future research is suggested to implement search functionalities, promote guidelines adoption, enhance KOS evolution, and assess the influence of language models on subject metadata utilization. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/mofcc-pick-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/mofcc-pick-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/mofcc-pick-1400.webp 1400w,/assets/img/publication_preview/mofcc-pick-1800.webp 1800w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/mofcc-pick.png" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="mofcc-pick.png" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div id="cotton_caring_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Caring Trouble and Musical AI: Considerations towards a Feminist Musical AI</div> <div class="author"> Kelsey Cotton , and Kıvanç Tatar </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In AIMC 2023</em> , Aug 2023 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a class="bibtex btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Bib</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The ethics of AI as both material and medium for interaction remains in murky waters within the context of musical and artistic practice. The interdisciplinarity of the field is revealing matters of concern and care, which necessitate interdisciplinary methodologies for evaluation to trouble and critique the inheritance of ‘residue-laden’ AI-tools in musical applications. Seeking to unsettle these murky waters, this paper critically examines the example of Holly+, a deep neural network that generates raw audio in the likeness of its creator Holly Herndon. Drawing from theoretical concerns and considerations from speculative feminism and care ethics, we care-fully trouble the structures, frameworks and assumptions that oscillate within and around Holly+. We contribute with several considerations and contemplate future directions for integrating speculative feminism and care into musical-AI agent and system design, derived from our critical feminist examination.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">cotton_caring_2023</span><span class="p">,</span>

In this work, we explore a well-known Deep Learning architecture called Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These architectures have been used in many areas for generating latent spaces where data points are organized so that similar data points locate closer to each other. Previously, VAEs have been used for generating latent timbre spaces or latent spaces of symbolic music excepts. Applying VAE to audio features of timbre requires a vocoder to transform the timbre generated by the network to an audio signal, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we apply VAEs to raw audio data directly while bypassing audio feature extraction. This approach allows the practitioners to use any audio recording while giving flexibility and control over the aesthetics through dataset curation. The lower computation time in audio signal generation allows the raw audio approach to be incorporated into real-time applications. In this work, we propose three strategies to explore latent spaces of audio and timbre for sound design applications. By doing so, our aim is to initiate a conversation on artistic approaches and strategies to utilize latent audio spaces in sound and music practices.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">tatar_sound_2023</span><span class="p">,</span>

Design/methodology/approach: A web-based questionnaire comprising 35 closed and open questions, 22 of which were required, was sent via online channels in January 2022. By the survey closing date, 20 March 2022, 82 responses had been received. The study was intended to complement an earlier study targeting end users. Findings: Both this study of librarians and the previous study of end users have painted a dismal image of online search services when it comes to searching for LGBTQI fiction. The need to consult different channels (e.g. social media, library catalogues and friends), the inability to search more specifically than for the broad LGBTQI category and suboptimal search interfaces were among the commonly reported issues. The results of these studies are used to inform the development of a dedicated Swedish LGBTQI fiction database with an online search interface. Originality/value: The subject searching of fiction via online services is usually limited to genre with facets for time and place, while users are often seeking characteristics such as pacing, characterization, storyline, frame/setting, tone and language/style. LGBTQI fiction is even more challenging to search because indexing practices are not really being standardized or disseminated worldwide. This study helps address this important gap, in both research and practical applications.  </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Golub1614980" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Organizing subject access to cultural heritage in Swedish online museums</div> <div class="author"> Koraljka Golub , Pawel Michal Ziolkowski , and Goran Zlodi </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Documentation</em>, Aug 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Purpose: The study aims to paint a representative picture of the current state of search interfaces of Swedish online museum collections, focussing on search functionalities with particular reference to subject searching, as well as the use of controlled vocabularies, with the purpose of identifying which improvements of the search interfaces are needed to ensure high-quality information retrieval for the end user. Design/methodology/approach: In the first step, a set of 21 search interface criteria was identified, based on related research and current standards in the domain of cultural heritage knowledge organization. Secondly, a complete set of Swedish museums that provide online access to their collections was identified, comprising nine cross-search services and 91 individual museums’ websites. These 100 websites were each evaluated against the 21 criteria, between 1 July and 31 August 2020. Findings: Although many standards and guidelines are in place to ensure quality-controlled subject indexing, which in turn support information retrieval of relevant resources (as individual or full search results), the study shows that they are not broadly implemented, resulting in information retrieval failures for the end user. The study also demonstrates a strong need for the implementation of controlled vocabularies in these museums. Originality/value: This study is a rare piece of research which examines subject searching in online museums; the 21 search criteria and their use in the analysis of the complete set of online collections of a country represents a considerable and unique contribution to the fields of knowledge organization and information retrieval of cultural heritage. Its particular value lies in showing how the needs of end users, many of which are documented and reflected in international standards and guidelines, should be taken into account in designing search tools for these museums; especially so in subject searching, which is the most complex and yet the most common type of search. Much effort has been invested into digitizing cultural heritage collections, but access to them is hindered by poor search functionality. This study identifies which are the most important aspects to improve. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Golub1700751" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Searching for Swedish LGBTQI fiction : challenges and solutions</div> <div class="author"> Koraljka Golub , Jenny Bergenmar , and Siska Humlesjö </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Documentation</em>, Aug 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the needs of potential end-users of a database dedicated to Swedish lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) literature (e.g. prose, poetry, drama, graphic novels/comics, and illustrated books), in order to inform the development of a database, search interface functionalities, and an LGBTQI thesaurus for fiction. Design/methodology/approach: A web questionnaire was distributed in autumn 2021 to potential end-users. The questions covered people’s reasons for reading LGBTQI fiction, ways of finding LGBTQI fiction, experience of searching for LGBTQI fiction, usual search elements applied, latest search for LGBTQI fiction, desired subjects to search for, and ideal search functionalities. Findings: The 101 completed questionnaires showed that most respondents found relevant literature through social media or friends and that most obtained copies of literature from a library. Regarding desirable search functionalities, most respondents would like to see suggestions for related terms to support broader search results (i.e. higher recall). Many also wanted search support that would enable retrieving more specific results based on narrower terms when too many results are retrieved (i.e. higher precision). Over half would also appreciate the option to browse by hierarchically arranged subjects. Originality/value: This study is the first to show how readers of LGBTQI fiction in Sweden search for and obtain relevant literature. The authors have identified end-user needs that can inform the development of a new database and a thesaurus dedicated to LGBTQI fiction. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Golub1620744" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Automated Subject Indexing : An Overview</div> <div class="author"> Koraljka Golub </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly</em>, Aug 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In the face of the ever-increasing document volume, libraries around the globe are more and more exploring (semi-) automated approaches to subject indexing.

It sets the stage for the volume’s 12 contributed chapters, which present case studies at the intersection of the two research areas. The contributions develop themes that highlight the specific opportunities and challenges of bringing these fields together. The themes of the chapters reflect the preeminent research topics of KO for DH: metadata in cultural heritage collections, which includes topics like conceptual models; data aggregation and metadata enrichment. Information management of textual collections, lexical resources and research outputs provide another important focus. Interfaces to cultural heritage collections and automated techniques are also addressed. Several chapters are directly driven by humanities research questions: one example is the ResearchSpace project, which demonstrates the ineffectiveness of data-based information organisation for historians. Another is the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and semantic annotation to explore a classical text. Finally, the chapter calls for transdisciplinary research collaborations that will bridge the gap within and at the intersections of KO and DH. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Golub1423645" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Automatic Classification of Swedish Metadata Using Dewey Decimal Classification : A Comparison of Approaches</div> <div class="author"> Koraljka Golub , Johan Hagelbäck , and Anders Ardö </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Data and Information Science</em>, Aug 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Purpose With more and more digital collections of various information resources becoming available, also increasing is the challenge of assigning subject index terms and classes from quality knowledge organization systems. While the ultimate purpose is to understand the value of automatically produced Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) classes for Swedish digital collections, the paper aims to evaluate the performance of six machine learning algorithms as well as a string-matching algorithm based on characteristics of DDC. Design/methodology/approach State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms require at least 1,000 training examples per class. The complete data set at the time of research involved 143,838 records which had to be reduced to top three hierarchical levels of DDC in order to provide sufficient training data (totaling 802 classes in the training and testing sample, out of 14,413 classes at all levels). Findings Evaluation shows that Support Vector Machine with linear kernel outperforms other machine learning algorithms as well as the string-matching algorithm on average; the string-matching algorithm outperforms machine learning for specific classes when characteristics of DDC are most suitable for the task. Word embeddings combined with different types of neural networks (simple linear network, standard neural network, 1D convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network) produced worse results than Support Vector Machine, but reach close results, with the benefit of a smaller representation size. Impact of features in machine learning shows that using keywords or combining titles and keywords gives better results than using only titles as input. Stemming only marginally improves the results. Removed stop-words reduced accuracy in most cases, while removing less frequent words increased it marginally. The greatest impact is produced by the number of training examples: 81.90% accuracy on the training set is achieved when at least 1,000 records per class are available in the training set, and 66.13% when too few records (often less than 100 per class) on which to train are available—and these hold only for top 3 hierarchical levels (803 instead of 14,413 classes). Research limitations Having to reduce the number of hierarchical levels to top three levels of DDC because of the lack of training data for all classes, skews the results so that they work in experimental conditions but barely for end users in operational retrieval systems. Practical implications In conclusion, for operative information retrieval systems applying purely automatic DDC does not work, either using machine learning (because of the lack of training data for the large number of DDC classes) or using string-matching algorithm (because DDC characteristics perform well for automatic classification only in a small number of classes). Over time, more training examples may become available, and DDC may be enriched with synonyms in order to enhance accuracy of automatic classification which may also benefit information retrieval performance based on DDC. In order for quality information services to reach the objective of highest possible precision and recall, automatic classification should never be implemented on its own; instead, machine-aided indexing that combines the efficiency of automatic suggestions with quality of human decisions at the final stage should be the way for the future. Originality/value The study explored machine learning on a large classification system of over 14,000 classes which is used in operational information retrieval systems. Due to lack of sufficient training data across the entire set of classes, an approach complementing machine learning, that of string matching, was applied. This combination should be explored further since it provides the potential for real-life applications with large target classification systems. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Golub1343297" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Digital humanities in Sweden and its infrastructure : Status quo and the sine qua non</div> <div class="author"> Koraljka Golub , Elisabet Göransson , Anna Foka , and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?

We identify two major developments that seem to be taking place within DH, with a specific focus on the infrastructural aspects of the development: (1) a strive to open up and broaden the research output and (2) multi-disciplinary collaboration and its effects. The two major components accentuate the new infrastructural patterns that are developing and the challenges these infer on universities. While current research is at large multi-disciplinary, developing infrastructures also enable the move towards post-disciplinarity, bringing the universities closer to the surrounding society. At five universities in Sweden, individual-sited infrastructures supporting DH research have been built today. They are complemented by national and international infrastructures, thus supporting developments and tackling some of the major challenges. In the article, the relations between individual disciplines, the question of multi- and post-disciplinarity, and the field of Digital Humanities are discussed, while stressing the factors necessary—sine qua non—for a fruitful development of the scholarly infrastructures. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2025 Kıvanç Tatar. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?b977fe0c21b2118ed853308b1b923969"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?699fa7cbe3b29f831db7d5250ba3203a"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?9b6fc7aeb2b96b27ea68c9fa31a41c0c"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?d359581efc54b08366f9ef8219e6e511" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?25eff8ff4144a010e4ad7b31403102cf"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.min.js"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
