We argue that while AI shows great potential for digitalisation, collections management and curation, its implementation is a complex endeavour. First, we discuss artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies with great potential such as computer vision and natural language processing, as well as the implementation of AI for heritage encounters. We then identify a number of challenges in implementing these technologies—namely using technology to address the diversity of human memory and culture that is inherent in cultural heritage collections, but also issues of accessibility and technical know-how. Finally, we envision the future potential of AI for the digitalisation of heritage. },

We argue that bias is inherent in cultural heritage collections (CHCs) and their digital versions and that AI pipelines may amplify this bias. We hypothesise that effective AI methods require vast, well-annotated datasets with structured metadata, which CHCs often lack due to diverse digitisation practices and limited interconnectivity. This paper discusses the definition of bias in CHCs and other datasets, exploring how it stems from training data and insufficient humanities expertise in generative platforms. We conclude that scholarship, guidelines, and policies on AI and CHCs should address bias as both inherent and augmented by AI technologies. We recommend implementing bias mitigation techniques throughout the process, from collection to curation, to support meaningful curation, embrace diversity, and cater to future heritage audiences. },

It outlines the multifaceted nature of bias—ranging from data selection and annotation to algorithmic design and user interaction—demonstrating how each stage of the AI pipeline can introduce or perpetuate distortions in representation. Through a critical review of current scholarship and practical case studies, particularly in image classification, the article evaluates technical strategies such as data augmentation, adversarial debiasing, and monitoring plans for bias mitigation. The findings reveal that while methods like noise injection and colour jittering can balance datasets and improve model fairness, effective bias mitigation ultimately depends on interdisciplinary collaboration between heritage professionals, subject experts, and data scientists. The article concludes that addressing bias requires an ongoing, holistic approach, integrating both technical and humanistic perspectives from data collection to model deployment. This ensures more inclusive, accurate, and ethically sound representations of cultural heritage, supporting the sector’s goals of diversity and accessibility for future audiences. },

   abstract = { In the context of Sweden’s digital transformation strategy, ensuring the availability of digital specialist competence has been identified as a critical challenge for innovation and economic growth. Current reports and analyses, including those by the OECD, highlight a growing gap between demand and supply in advanced digital skills, posing a bottleneck for industrial and technological development. To address this, the Swedish government has tasked agencies and research groups with formulating strategies for sustainable competence provision. This paper presents a future-oriented analysis aimed at outlining plausible development trajectories for digital specialist competence in Sweden up to 2035. Building on a comprehensive SWOT analysis, trend forecasting, and policy reviews, this study delineates eight distinct future scenarios that explore potential pathways for competence provision. These range from a continuation of the status quo to more transformative developments such as industry-driven initiatives, increased individual responsibility, global talent mobility, and a more flexible and responsive higher education system. Some scenarios envision a diversification of the educational landscape, including non-traditional learning environments, while others highlight systemic change through digital transformation and extensive institutional restructuring. Each scenario is analyzed in relation to key drivers such as education policy, technological advancements, labor market shifts, and international competitiveness. The study underscores that achieving sustainable digital competence provision requires more than isolated initiatives; rather, it necessitates a systemic approach integrating education, industry, and policy frameworks. Gender equality, sustainability, and lifelong learning emerge as crucial dimensions for ensuring inclusivity and adaptability in digital competence strategies. The full paper will further elaborate on these scenarios and assess the actual developments a few years after the initial projections, providing a comparative analysis of anticipated versus realized progress in Sweden’s digital competence landscape. By doing so, it aims to inform policymakers, educators, and industry stakeholders on effective strategies for aligning competence development with the rapidly evolving digital ecosystem. },

This chapter focuses on the process of creating an enriched digital edition of Pausanias's Periegesis Hellados or Description of Greece. The purpose of this research is twofold: to identify 'heritage data' in Pausanias and to describe the technical and epistemological parameters of their aggregation and organisation. In answering the essentially digital humanities research question "how Pausanias's literary heritage information can be best organised and connected to the archaeological record on the ground", the Digital Periegesis project is charting and analysing the relevant digital tools and methods by which extensive semantic annotation and Linked Open Data (LOD) can facilitate the organisation of heritage information in Pausanias's text and its connection to actual archaeological finds. This chapter discusses the potential application of Geographic Information Science (GISc) and Geographic Information System (GIS) for such complex pre-cartesian narrative analysis. Finally, it emphasises the importance of building geo-spatially enriched digital editions collaboratively, involving discipline specialist researchers and information organisation experts, with the aim of interpreting histories of "place". },

The article centres on the perspectives of the CHI professionals who deliver that implementation. Its purpose is to elucidate how CHI professionals respond to the opportunities and challenges AI/ML provides. The three Swedish CHIs discussed here represent different organizational frameworks and have different types of collections, while sharing, to some extent, a similar position in terms of the use of AI/ML tools and methodologies. The overarching question of this article is what is the state of knowledge about AI/ML among Swedish CHI professionals, and what are the related issues? To answer this question, we draw on (1) semi-structured interviews with CHI professionals, (2) individual CHI website information, and (3) CHI-internal digitization protocols and digitalization strategies, to provide a nuanced analysis of both professional and organisational processes concerning the implementation of AI/ML methods and tools. Our study indicates that AI/ML implementation is in many ways at the very early stages of implementation in Swedish CHIs. The CHI professionals are affected in their AI/ML engagement by four key issues that emerged in the interviews: their institutional and professional knowledge regarding AI/ML; the specificities of their collections and associated digitization and digitalization issues; issues around personnel; and issues around AI/ML resources. The article suggests that a national CHI strategy for AI/ML might be helpful as would be knowledge-, expertise-, and potentially personnel- and resource-sharing to move beyond the constraints that the CHIs face in implementing AI/ML. },

The UNESCO heritage model, rooted in concepts of physical fixity and authenticity, is shown as inadequate for born-digital works like comics, which derive meaning from technological infrastructure, dynamic platforms, and ongoing community interaction rather than static material forms. Drawing on heritage futures and digital materiality theories, the authors argue that digital comics exemplify "temporal authenticity," evolving through continual transformation and algorithmic curation. The paper details how platform recommendation systems and analytics directly shape which comics achieve cultural visibility and preservation, while community-driven initiatives—such as The Flashpoint Archive—demonstrate effective models for holistic, grassroots digital preservation beyond institutional reach. Ultimately, the study calls for new theoretical and practical approaches to heritage, recognizing digital comics as both cultural artifacts and dynamic, platform-specific vernacular expressions. },

	abstract = {The research in Deep Learning applications in sound and music computing have gathered an interest in the recent years; however, there is still a missing link between these new technologies and on how they can be incorporated into real-world artistic practices. In this work, we explore a well-known Deep Learning architecture called Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These architectures have been used in many areas for generating latent spaces where data points are organized so that similar data points locate closer to each other. Previously, VAEs have been used for generating latent timbre spaces or latent spaces of symbolic music excepts. Applying VAE to audio features of timbre requires a vocoder to transform the timbre generated by the network to an audio signal, which is computationally expensive. In this work, we apply VAEs to raw audio data directly while bypassing audio feature extraction. This approach allows the practitioners to use any audio recording while giving flexibility and control over the aesthetics through dataset curation. The lower computation time in audio signal generation allows the raw audio approach to be incorporated into real-time applications. In this work, we propose three strategies to explore latent spaces of audio and timbre for sound design applications. By doing so, our aim is to initiate a conversation on artistic approaches and strategies to utilize latent audio spaces in sound and music practices.},

   abstract = {To ensure the systematic, coherent and rational description of objects in and across collections, metadata standards for subject indexing have therefore been established. These metadata standards have evolved over time to accommodate changing needs, growing and diversifying collections, and emerging digital affordances. Yet, for numerous reasons, subject metadata are neither fully nor rigorously implemented in many of today’s catalogues – whether in the backend indices or the front-end end-user interfaces – to the detriment of users. Online public library catalogues, discovery services, journal article databases, university repositories and museum catalogues all demonstrate shortcomings in how subject metadata are integrated, consolidated and leveraged (Golub 2016; Golub 2018; Golub et al. 2020; Golub, Ziolkowski and Zlodi 2022). Properly incorporated, subject metadata could greatly improve the discovery of objects within collections and (because collections are increasingly connected online) the reconciliation of descriptive information across different collections for better cross-database searching. On the other hand, digital technologies could make standardised subject access finally realise the potential always envisioned for it. To make this argument, we explore subject access and associated metadata standards in library and museum cataloguing.  },

How successful they are will depend on subject indexing applied in these services (among other factors). The study aimed to determine: (1) to what degree are Queerlit books identified as LGBTQ+ books in widely used information services, in particular Google Books, LibraryThing and Goodreads; and, (2) whether metadata in these information services could be considered of value for the Queerlit database and complement its highly extensive and highly specific indexing. Design/methodology/approachThe study compared keywords (subject index terms, tags) assigned to works of Swedish LGBTQ+ fiction across three commercial services: Google Books, Goodreads and LibraryThing, against the curated database, Queerlit. FindingsOf the 1320 LGBTQ+ works in Queerlit, only a small portion was found in the three web services: 8.26% on Google Books (n = 109), 13.26% on Goodreads (n = 175), while about half on LibraryThing (55.3%, n = 730). This underrepresentation of Swedish LGBTQ+ works in the three international commercial information services makes them hardly of value to the readers. This is exacerbated by the fact that only a minority of Queerlit books found in the three services are categorised as LGBTQ+. The Queerlit database might benefit from consulting social tagging services when indexing both LGBTQ+ specific and general themes. Originality/valueNo earlier study compared in a systematic manner four different information retrieval systems and identified challenges as well as potential benefits in relation to finding LGBTQ+ fiction. },

Design/methodology/approach: A web-based questionnaire comprising 35 closed and open questions, 22 of which were required, was sent via online channels in January 2022. By the survey closing date, 20 March 2022, 82 responses had been received. The study was intended to complement an earlier study targeting end users. Findings: Both this study of librarians and the previous study of end users have painted a dismal image of online search services when it comes to searching for LGBTQI fiction. The need to consult different channels (e.g. social media, library catalogues and friends), the inability to search more specifically than for the broad LGBTQI category and suboptimal search interfaces were among the commonly reported issues. The results of these studies are used to inform the development of a dedicated Swedish LGBTQI fiction database with an online search interface. Originality/value: The subject searching of fiction via online services is usually limited to genre with facets for time and place, while users are often seeking characteristics such as pacing, characterization, storyline, frame/setting, tone and language/style. LGBTQI fiction is even more challenging to search because indexing practices are not really being standardized or disseminated worldwide. This study helps address this important gap, in both research and practical applications.  },

Design/methodology/approach: In the first step, a set of 21 search interface criteria was identified, based on related research and current standards in the domain of cultural heritage knowledge organization. Secondly, a complete set of Swedish museums that provide online access to their collections was identified, comprising nine cross-search services and 91 individual museums' websites. These 100 websites were each evaluated against the 21 criteria, between 1 July and 31 August 2020. Findings: Although many standards and guidelines are in place to ensure quality-controlled subject indexing, which in turn support information retrieval of relevant resources (as individual or full search results), the study shows that they are not broadly implemented, resulting in information retrieval failures for the end user. The study also demonstrates a strong need for the implementation of controlled vocabularies in these museums. Originality/value: This study is a rare piece of research which examines subject searching in online museums; the 21 search criteria and their use in the analysis of the complete set of online collections of a country represents a considerable and unique contribution to the fields of knowledge organization and information retrieval of cultural heritage. Its particular value lies in showing how the needs of end users, many of which are documented and reflected in international standards and guidelines, should be taken into account in designing search tools for these museums; especially so in subject searching, which is the most complex and yet the most common type of search. Much effort has been invested into digitizing cultural heritage collections, but access to them is hindered by poor search functionality. This study identifies which are the most important aspects to improve. },

Design/methodology/approach: A web questionnaire was distributed in autumn 2021 to potential end-users. The questions covered people's reasons for reading LGBTQI fiction, ways of finding LGBTQI fiction, experience of searching for LGBTQI fiction, usual search elements applied, latest search for LGBTQI fiction, desired subjects to search for, and ideal search functionalities. Findings: The 101 completed questionnaires showed that most respondents found relevant literature through social media or friends and that most obtained copies of literature from a library. Regarding desirable search functionalities, most respondents would like to see suggestions for related terms to support broader search results (i.e. higher recall). Many also wanted search support that would enable retrieving more specific results based on narrower terms when too many results are retrieved (i.e. higher precision). Over half would also appreciate the option to browse by hierarchically arranged subjects.

   abstract = {Purpose With more and more digital collections of various information resources becoming available, also increasing is the challenge of assigning subject index terms and classes from quality knowledge organization systems. While the ultimate purpose is to understand the value of automatically produced Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) classes for Swedish digital collections, the paper aims to evaluate the performance of six machine learning algorithms as well as a string-matching algorithm based on characteristics of DDC. Design/methodology/approach State-of-the-art machine learning algorithms require at least 1,000 training examples per class. The complete data set at the time of research involved 143,838 records which had to be reduced to top three hierarchical levels of DDC in order to provide sufficient training data (totaling 802 classes in the training and testing sample, out of 14,413 classes at all levels). Findings Evaluation shows that Support Vector Machine with linear kernel outperforms other machine learning algorithms as well as the string-matching algorithm on average; the string-matching algorithm outperforms machine learning for specific classes when characteristics of DDC are most suitable for the task. Word embeddings combined with different types of neural networks (simple linear network, standard neural network, 1D convolutional neural network, and recurrent neural network) produced worse results than Support Vector Machine, but reach close results, with the benefit of a smaller representation size. Impact of features in machine learning shows that using keywords or combining titles and keywords gives better results than using only titles as input. Stemming only marginally improves the results. Removed stop-words reduced accuracy in most cases, while removing less frequent words increased it marginally. The greatest impact is produced by the number of training examples: 81.90% accuracy on the training set is achieved when at least 1,000 records per class are available in the training set, and 66.13% when too few records (often less than 100 per class) on which to train are available—and these hold only for top 3 hierarchical levels (803 instead of 14,413 classes). Research limitations Having to reduce the number of hierarchical levels to top three levels of DDC because of the lack of training data for all classes, skews the results so that they work in experimental conditions but barely for end users in operational retrieval systems. Practical implications In conclusion, for operative information retrieval systems applying purely automatic DDC does not work, either using machine learning (because of the lack of training data for the large number of DDC classes) or using string-matching algorithm (because DDC characteristics perform well for automatic classification only in a small number of classes). Over time, more training examples may become available, and DDC may be enriched with synonyms in order to enhance accuracy of automatic classification which may also benefit information retrieval performance based on DDC. In order for quality information services to reach the objective of highest possible precision and recall, automatic classification should never be implemented on its own; instead, machine-aided indexing that combines the efficiency of automatic suggestions with quality of human decisions at the final stage should be the way for the future. Originality/value The study explored machine learning on a large classification system of over 14,000 classes which is used in operational information retrieval systems. Due to lack of sufficient training data across the entire set of classes, an approach complementing machine learning, that of string matching, was applied. This combination should be explored further since it provides the potential for real-life applications with large target classification systems. },

The two major components accentuate the new infrastructural patterns that are developing and the challenges these infer on universities. While current research is at large multi-disciplinary, developing infrastructures also enable the move towards post-disciplinarity, bringing the universities closer to the surrounding society. At five universities in Sweden, individual-sited infrastructures supporting DH research have been built today. They are complemented by national and international infrastructures, thus supporting developments and tackling some of the major challenges.
