The chapter contributes a detailed methodology for collection enrichment, including the possibilities and pitfalls of using emerging technologies, specifically AI, for classification and enrichment so as to open up new critical questions about historical women. },

   abstract = {This chapter provides a critical examination of the promise of AI technology with a focus on museums and cultural heritage organisations. We argue that while AI shows great potential for digitalisation, collections management and curation, its implementation is a complex endeavour. First, we discuss artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies with great potential such as computer vision and natural language processing, as well as the implementation of AI for heritage encounters. We then identify a number of challenges in implementing these technologies—namely using technology to address the diversity of human memory and culture that is inherent in cultural heritage collections, but also issues of accessibility and technical know-how. Finally, we envision the future potential of AI for the digitalisation of heritage. },

   abstract = {Our article AI, cultural heritage, and bias examines the challenges and potential solutions for using machine learning to interpret and classify human memory and cultural heritage artifacts. We argue that bias is inherent in cultural heritage collections (CHCs) and their digital versions and that AI pipelines may amplify this bias. We hypothesise that effective AI methods require vast, well-annotated datasets with structured metadata, which CHCs often lack due to diverse digitisation practices and limited interconnectivity. This paper discusses the definition of bias in CHCs and other datasets, exploring how it stems from training data and insufficient humanities expertise in generative platforms. We conclude that scholarship, guidelines, and policies on AI and CHCs should address bias as both inherent and augmented by AI technologies. We recommend implementing bias mitigation techniques throughout the process, from collection to curation, to support meaningful curation, embrace diversity, and cater to future heritage audiences. },

   abstract = {This article investigates the pervasive issue of bias within AI-driven cultural heritage collections, emphasizing how digital technologies both inherit and amplify existing societal and historical prejudices embedded in analogue records. It outlines the multifaceted nature of bias—ranging from data selection and annotation to algorithmic design and user interaction—demonstrating how each stage of the AI pipeline can introduce or perpetuate distortions in representation. Through a critical review of current scholarship and practical case studies, particularly in image classification, the article evaluates technical strategies such as data augmentation, adversarial debiasing, and monitoring plans for bias mitigation. The findings reveal that while methods like noise injection and colour jittering can balance datasets and improve model fairness, effective bias mitigation ultimately depends on interdisciplinary collaboration between heritage professionals, subject experts, and data scientists. The article concludes that addressing bias requires an ongoing, holistic approach, integrating both technical and humanistic perspectives from data collection to model deployment. This ensures more inclusive, accurate, and ethically sound representations of cultural heritage, supporting the sector’s goals of diversity and accessibility for future audiences. },

   abstract = {This article examines the challenges and opportunities that arise with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods and tools when implemented within cultural heritage institutions (CHIs), focusing on three selected Swedish case studies. The article centres on the perspectives of the CHI professionals who deliver that implementation. Its purpose is to elucidate how CHI professionals respond to the opportunities and challenges AI/ML provides. The three Swedish CHIs discussed here represent different organizational frameworks and have different types of collections, while sharing, to some extent, a similar position in terms of the use of AI/ML tools and methodologies. The overarching question of this article is what is the state of knowledge about AI/ML among Swedish CHI professionals, and what are the related issues? To answer this question, we draw on (1) semi-structured interviews with CHI professionals, (2) individual CHI website information, and (3) CHI-internal digitization protocols and digitalization strategies, to provide a nuanced analysis of both professional and organisational processes concerning the implementation of AI/ML methods and tools. Our study indicates that AI/ML implementation is in many ways at the very early stages of implementation in Swedish CHIs. The CHI professionals are affected in their AI/ML engagement by four key issues that emerged in the interviews: their institutional and professional knowledge regarding AI/ML; the specificities of their collections and associated digitization and digitalization issues; issues around personnel; and issues around AI/ML resources. The article suggests that a national CHI strategy for AI/ML might be helpful as would be knowledge-, expertise-, and potentially personnel- and resource-sharing to move beyond the constraints that the CHIs face in implementing AI/ML. },

   abstract = {AI and Image illustrates the importance of critical perspectives in the study of AI and its application to image collections in the art and heritage sector. The authors' approach is that such entanglements of image and AI are neither dystopian or utopian but may amplify, reduce or condense existing societal inequalities depending on how they may be implemented in relation to human expertise and sensibility in terms of diversity and inclusion. The Element further discusses regulations around the use of AI for such cultural datasets as they touch upon legalities, regulations and ethics. In the conclusion they emphasise the importance of the professional expert factor in the entanglements of AI and images and advocate for a continuous and renegotiating professional symbiosis between human and machines.
